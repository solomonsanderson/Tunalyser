## Description
** Work in Progress ** 

Tunalyser is a music player which lets you visualise music whilst you listen to it!

The key library is Librosa which can be used to extrapolate and visualise lots of data from a range of sound file formats.

## Example UI
This is the current layout of the UI, the play/pause button, exit buttons and song selector are the only currently functional parts.
