# Tunalyser - Music Player & Analyser
## Description
** Work in Progress ** 

Tunalyser is a music player which lets you visualise ou music whilst you listen to it!

The key library is Librosa which can be used to extrapolate and visualise lots of data from a range of sound file formats.

## Example Figure 
A plot is shown below which is an example of the plots I would like to integrate in the future.
